# NLP Learning Resources

This repository contains various Jupyter notebooks covering key Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts. These are essential for anyone starting their journey in NLP and provide foundational knowledge on text preprocessing and analysis techniques.

## Notebooks Overview

1. **[Tokenization.ipynb](Tokenization.ipynb)**
   - This notebook demonstrates how to split text into individual tokens (words, sentences, or sub-words). Tokenization is the first step in text processing for most NLP tasks.

2. **[Stop Words.ipynb](Stop%20Words.ipynb)**
   - In this notebook, we explore the concept of stop words, which are common words (like 'and', 'is', 'the') that are often removed in text processing to focus on meaningful words.

3. **[Stemming.ipynb](Stemming.ipynb)**
   - This notebook explains stemming, a text normalization technique that reduces words to their base or root form by removing suffixes (e.g., 'running' becomes 'run').

4. **[Lemmatization.ipynb](Lemmatization.ipynb)**
   - Unlike stemming, lemmatization considers the context and transforms words into their base forms (lemmas), ensuring that the resulting word is a valid one (e.g., 'better' becomes 'good').

5. **[Bi_gram & Tri_gram.ipynb](Bi_gram%20&%20Tri_gram.ipynb)**
   - This notebook covers bi-grams and tri-grams, which are sequences of two or three words used together in text analysis. These are often used to capture phrases or patterns in language.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Install required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Running the Notebooks

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anubothu-Aravind/NLP.git
   cd NLP
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open any of the `.ipynb` files and run the cells to explore each topic.

## Topics Covered
- Tokenization: Breaking down text into words or sentences.
- Stop Word Removal: Eliminating common, non-informative words.
- Stemming and Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root forms.
- N-grams: Analyzing word sequences like bi-grams and tri-grams.
