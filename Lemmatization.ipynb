To help improve his rank, Gopal moves to Kota alone to join reputed coaching classes to resit the exam the following year. Raghav goes on to pass the IIT entrance exam as well, and starts attending Banaras Hindu University.\n",

    "During Gopal's absence in Kota, Aarti and Raghav develop feelings for each other, and Aarti tells Gopal about her relationship when they chat online. Gopal is heartbroken and lashes out at her, causing them to lose touch briefly and Gopal to fall behind in his course. When they rekindle their friendship, Gopal begins to study hard again, but gets a low rank once more after sitting the AIEEE exam for the second time. Gopal returns home to Varanasi, where his father dies shortly after learning of his low rank. Meanwhile, Raghav and Aarti's relationship is flourishing, and Raghav has found his passion in activism and being on his university's newspaper committee.\n",
